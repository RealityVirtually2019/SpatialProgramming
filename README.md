# SpatialProgramming

Spatial programming is the beginnings of a node based progamming interface, like [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), but in mixed reality. The idea stemmed from a desire to learn programming while rapidly prototyping for mixed reality. The productivity potentials for a system like caught our imagination as much as the educational potentials.

Some ideas for how this system can be built upon include:
* multi-user collaboration
* connect IOT devices to literally program your environment
* importing & parse scripts to visualize more complex program flows
